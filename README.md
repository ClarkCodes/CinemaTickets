## Project Description
CinemaTickets was born as a University school project, in Software Engineering academic career, as resolution of Object Oriented Programming subject and its purpose was to demostrate and put on practice and evidence all the knowledge acquired along the semester in this subject, which I was able to successfully achieve by getting a Project rating of 10/10.

This is a Cinema Managenemt System focused mainly on making and getting Cinema Tickets all the way:
It performs CRUD operations just inside the application (with no database connection, only with collections), it can open and save application files, perform searches applying different filters, providing an easy-to-use GUI, friendly and intuitive for a great experience and with a decent level of customization and personalization, it supports User Settings, GUI Laf themes, Binary and Text saving/opening CinemaTickets files, it is available in English and Spanish, and more features coming on future versions.

CinemaTickets is built with Java OpenJDK 17.0.2, it is a project that is actually an interesting exercise made for University school but also for those who are learning and seeking for knowledge, for a way to know how to do things, how to code and perform basic-intermediate Java tasks in programming, for those who are looking for a little bit of inspiration, or even only for feeding curiosity.

This project is an example of hypothetical use cases, sticked to not be too hard for a student, but it is evolving in every version to be more realistic and professional as a real world environment application, this is not yet complete, but it is intended to eventually fullfill this purpose. Although this app does well what it has to do, it is not meant to be used in a real commercial/production environment for a company, at least not as it is in this version, some changes and adaptations would be necessary to be done before that could happen in an effective way, but for now there are no plans to do it, however, that possibility is not discarded for a future version.

## Make sure you are not missing details
For a more complete and detailed features description, please check and read the releases available where a more in deep application content is shared.

###
### How can you use or open the CinemaTickets project?
* Clone the repository locally, select the "Open with GitHub Desktop" option or Download it as ZIP from the 'Code -> Local' button, located in the repository.
* Note that it is developed with Apache NetBeans IDE, so it is recommended the use of this IDE, you must have it installed on your computer to be able to open the project with it, although the option to import/open it with other IDEs such as IntelliJ Idea is possible, it is not recommended due to lack of compatibility and interoperability of each other, as well as the difference of certain formats for the handling of GUI files, etc., as well as possibly with other IDEs, however this is entirely at your own risk and expense, if you want to open it with another IDE and you can get it to work, great!
* Once you have done the previous step you will probably be able to open the project already, open Apache NetBeans IDE (or whatever IDE you have decided to use), select the open project option in the file menu, go to the project folder and click open.
* Configure NetBeans to use Gradle 8.1.
* When the project opens it is possible that it indicates you that there are conflicts pending to resolve, this is usually because an initial compilation has to be done with Gradle, click on resolve and wait for the compilation to be done and click on accept when it finishes.
* If everything went well you will be able to run the project, review its code and modify it if you want.

## How to contribute?
If you want to contribute code to the project: 
* Make a [FORK](https://github.com/clarkcodes/CinemaTickets/fork) of the project and work with Git to synchronize updates. 
* Once you have done the fork and have it in your GitHub profile, clone it to your local machine.
* You can aim to resolve a bug, which should have an open issue marked with the bug tag, so checking the issues section is a good place to start. Bug fixes can be developed without prior approval.
* On the other hand, you can also propose a new feature, to do this first open a new issue and be sure to mark it with the 'Enhancement' label/tag, and within this describe in detail the feature, what need or problem it solves and why it would be a good idea to incorporate it into the project.
* This Enhancement issue must be reviewed and once it is evaluated as viable, timely and adequate for the project, it will be approved through an approval message in the issue or an equivalent mean, and it will remain open until a Pull Request is provided for its implementation. Once the Feature is approved in the Enhancement issue, you can begin to develop it, it is important to wait for this approval so as not to spend time in vain if the feature is not approved, if this second scenario happens, it will be explained in the issue why it was not approved, stating the reason in a logical way, and after that, it will be closed.
* Once you consider that you have completed the development you have chosen, and once you have performed tests and verified that everything works fine, make the commit locally, but when you do a commit, please follow the following [Guidelines for writing Messages in Commits](https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53) and good practices about it.
* Execute a 'git push' from your local develop branch to the remote develop branch of your CinemaTickets forked project in your repositories, with this, you will have your forked project updated with the changes you have made, now you have to take them to the ClarkCodes repository.
* In order to do this, go to the CinemaTickets original project [ClarkCodes/CinemaTickets](https://github.com/ClarkCodes/CinemaTickets) in the ClarkCodes repositories, then go to the 'develop' branch(important step) and there make a Pull Request: Contribute -> Create Pull Request. For Pull Request titles and messages follow the same guidelines as for commits. With this, you have created the Pull Request, which has to be reviewed and then it has to be resolved if your changes are accepted and incorporated into the project or not, which will be the decision of the project and repository maintainer.

### Take into account the following aspects:
* For Contributions only code changes in Java files and/or files having to do with Apache NetBeans IDE 17 or resource files will be accepted, Pull Requests containing files referring to other development IDEs and which are not Java or resource files will not be accepted.
* Use only the "develop" branch, which is the branch intended for the application development, the main branch will be only the production branch intended for the stable version.
* Always request changes by a Pull Request, don't make forced commits like 'git push --force' of any type directly against any branch, only make Pull Requests on the develop branch. All Pull Requests must be previously reviewed before possibly perform a merge if there is no problem, conflict or inconvenience.
* Although it may happen that at some point some Pull Request may not be accepted or changes are requested in this one, because in the first place, I must prioritize the consistency, coherence and integrity of the project, for the good and health of this one, beyond that, of course every contribution is welcome and appreciated, since it is understood that it is not an obligation by any mean and this comes from the spirit of joint collaboration as Open Source community of developers, by and for better pieces and products of software, for the use of all after all, so fraternally, thank you very much for it.

## Thanks for visiting
Of course this project is not perfect and it is not pretended for it to be, there are some aspects that could have be done in a better way, some things that could improve and it is possible to work on updates in further versions, but this has to be taken as an exercise and practice project that could evolve.

Thank you very much for visiting and check this project out, I hope you like it, it was made with love and passion, as everything I do, I really enjoyed doing it, it's been pretty cool, so I'll be seeing you here soon with more projects, on YouTube with more videos and on the other social networks as well, hugs, cheers... with love and enthusiasm and... 

Happy Coding! <3 

`Clark`.
