### Cinema Management System - Basic University Java School Project - Software Engineering - OOP

CinemaTickets is a project that was born as a school project of University, in Software Engineering career, in Object Oriented Programming subject and the purpose 
of this is to demostrate and put on practice all the knowledge acquired along the semester. 

This is a Cinema Managenemt System focused on Cinema Tickets production all the way:
CRUD operations just inside the application (with no database connection, only with collections), open and save application files, searches, etc... providing a easy-to-use GUI,
friendly and intuitive for a great experience and with a minimun level of customizing and personalization, it supports GUI Laf themes and user settings.

CinemaTickets is built with Java 16 OpenJDK, it is an interesting exercise made for school but also for those who are learning and seeking for knowledge, for a way to do and perform
basic-intermediate tasks in Programming, for a little bit of inspiration, or even only for feeding curiosity.

Anyway, thanks for check it out, I hope you like it, it was made with love and passion, as everything I do...

Cheers... with love and enthusiasm, Clark.
Happy Coding!... <3
