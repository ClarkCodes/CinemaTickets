CinemaTickets was born as a school project of University, in Software Engineering career, as resolution of Object Oriented Programming subject and its purpose was to demostrate and put on practice all the knowledge acquired along the semester in this subject, which I was able to successfully achieve by getting a 10/10 rating.

## Project Description
This is a Cinema Managenemt System focused on making and getting Cinema Tickets all the way:
CRUD operations just inside the application (with no database connection, only with collections), open and save application files, performing searches applying different filters, providing an easy-to-use GUI, friendly and intuitive for a great experience and with a decent level of customizing and personalization, it supports user settings, GUI Laf themes, binary and text saving/opening CinemaTickets files, support for different languages: English and Spanish, and more features coming on future versions.

CinemaTickets is built with Java 17.0.2 OpenJDK (started developed in Java 16 but it was upgraded), it is an interesting exercise made for school but also for those who are learning and seeking for knowledge, for a way to do, to code and perform basic-intermediate Java tasks in programming, for a little bit of inspiration, or even only for feeding curiosity.

This project is an example of hypothetical use cases, sticked to be not too hard for a student, but it is evolving in every version to be more realistic and professional as a real world environment application, this is not yet complete, but it is intended to eventually fullfill this purpose, a bit more in every version, although it does well what it has to do, it is not meant to be used in production for a company in a real commercial environment, at least not as it is in this version, some changes and adaptations would have to be done before that could happen in an effective way, but for now there are no plans to do it, however, that possibility is not discarded for a future version.

## Make sure you are not missing details
For a more complete and detailed features description, please check and read the releases available where a more deep application content is shared.

## Thanks for visiting
Of course this project is not perfect and it is not pretended for it to be, there are some aspects that could have be done in a better way, some things that could improve and it is possible to make updates in further versions, but this has to be taken as an exercise and practice project that is evolving over time.

Anyway, thanks for check it out, I hope you like it, it was made with love and passion, as everything I do...

Cheers... with love and enthusiasm, Clark.
Happy Coding!... <3
